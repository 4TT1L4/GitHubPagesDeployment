# GitHubPagesDeployment

This repository contains a simple example deploying some generated static HTML content to GitHub Pages from a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/4TT1L4/GitHubPagesDeployment/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

The documentation is simply generated using a [bash script](https://github.com/4TT1L4/GitHubPagesDeployment/blob/main/generate-docs.sh), which is generating some statis HTML content from a template file with placeholder.
