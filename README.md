# GitHubPagesDeployment

This repository contains a simple example deploying some generated static HTML content to GitHub Pages from a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/4TT1L4/GitHubPagesDeployment/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

The documentation is simply generated using a [bash script](https://github.com/4TT1L4/GitHubPagesDeployment/blob/main/generate-docs.sh), which is generating some static HTML content from a template file with placeholder. The place holders are populated by some dummy data, so the documentation generation could be simulated for the purpose of this demo.

For the generated documentation hosted on GitHub Pages, please see the following URL:
